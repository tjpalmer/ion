At present, this is a port of the Ion compiler from C to Ion, derived directly
from Per Vognsen's [Bitwise](https://github.com/pervognsen/bitwise) project.

See also the [Ion motivation document](https://github.com/pervognsen/bitwise/blob/master/notes/ion_motivation.md)
for some of the original goals of Ion.
In my own opinion, the non-goals of Ion (such the "no 'best language ever'
syndrome") have actually allowed it to be better than some alternatives.
It's unbloated.
It's pragmatic and serves very well as a better C.
It compiles fast and without effort.

This makes it a great core language and potentially a great language to tinker
on.

Just my own two cents.
